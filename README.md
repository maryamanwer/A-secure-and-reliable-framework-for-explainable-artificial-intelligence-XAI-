# A Secure and Reliable Framework for Explainable AI in Smart Cities

## Overview
This repository presents a framework for developing a secure and reliable Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) system, tailored for smart city applications. The project aims to integrate interpretability and transparency into AI decision-making processes, ensuring trust and compliance with ethical standards.

## Key Features
- **Explainable Models**: Implementation of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHAP for interpretability.
- **Smart City Analysis**: Integration of smart city indices like Smart Mobility, Environment, Governance, Economy, People, and Living.
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive bar plots, heatmaps, and geospatial visualizations for analyzing smart city metrics.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression for classification.
  - Random Forest Regressor with SHAP values for feature importance.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping smart city data using Folium for enhanced insights.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `folium`
- `sklearn`
- `shap`
- `lime`
- `pdpbox`

To install all dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Sources
The framework uses:
1. **Smart Cities Index Dataset**: Contains key metrics for evaluating smart city features.
2. **World Cities Dataset**: Provides geospatial and demographic data for cities worldwide.
3. **Country and Continent Mapping Dataset**: Links countries to their respective continents.

Ensure these datasets are placed in the appropriate input directory.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maryamanwer/A-secure-and-reliable-framework-for-explainable-artificial-intelligence-XAI
   cd repo-name
   ```
2. Run the data preprocessing script to clean and merge datasets.
3. Execute the visualization and analysis scripts to generate plots and maps.
4. Train and evaluate machine learning models with the processed data.

## Visualizations
- **Bar Plots**: Compare smart city indices across regions.
- **Heatmaps**: Highlight correlations and distribution patterns in metrics.
- **Interactive Maps**: Display smart city data geospatially.

## Future Work
- Expand XAI integration for additional machine learning models.
- Develop a user-friendly dashboard for real-time smart city monitoring.
- Incorporate user feedback for iterative improvement.

## Conclusion
This framework showcases the application of XAI techniques in enhancing trust and interpretability within smart city ecosystems. By integrating robust visualizations and explainable models, it aims to provide actionable insights for urban development and policy-making.
